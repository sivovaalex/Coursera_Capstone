            "source": "Introduction\nFood inspection involves sampling and testing of end products, assessing food centers to ensure compliance with food safety management systems. This minimizes the occurrence of public health food safety problems. Currently, some cities in the united states e.g. San Francisco are implementing a technologically driven approach to food inspection to try and predict food establishments that are more likely to be non-compliant to food safety regulation. This is driven in part by the low Inspector to Food place ratio making it difficult to efficiently inspect all the food places. We will use Foursquare which comes with venue data that contains key descriptors of different venues including the category and popularity. "
